# Assignment 3: Deterioration of the Sea in a TV

Dataset Overview for Assignment 3

Throughout the weeks with what I have learned. I have figured that through having the AI generate my work from texts to photos that I have found my original idea to another approach to showcase the deterioration of the sea.

### Process ==
This dataset on the GitHub has the dataset that I used for generating the photos shown on the TV. This was also inspired by the one artist on class with their portrayal on the lifetime of flowers by putting flowers with TVs showcasing the life of each. In my context, I want to showcase the seas with symbolism on a TV at the shore of the ocean. I created this with the Google collab notebooks we learned on class to generatee the texts and photos to showcase my progress throughout the class as well with my usage on creating a work with AI. 

Intentions
I wanted to still stay true with my intentions to showcase the life of corals and the seas from life to death. I wanted to provoke also that the Sea can showcase different symbolisms that could be seen by also integrating concept of Life, Death, Hell, Bleach, and Corals in the Sea. I found out that by intergrating the concepts that each has showcased me:
+Sea and Life: The seas have so much in store for everyone, whether it may be jewelry or food.
+Sea and Death: Just as how time doesn't stop for us, the sea will also have its inevitable end.
+Sea and Hell: A merchandiser can experience hell in the transpotation of its goods as the sea can also be a medium for transportation between lands but also a consumer if the merchandiser is careless.
+Sea and Bleach: Imagine the Mondego, a large river in Portugal which is beautiful and amazing, but with the death of the sea that it looks like the icy white place Serra da Estrella in a sense if we do not take care of the sea enough.
+Sea and Corals in the Sea: Just as we can see and admire them just for a glimpse, it can be a home to other creatures as well.
