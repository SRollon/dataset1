# Dataset for my Assignment 2: Deterioration of the Sea

Dataset Overview for Assignment 2

This dataset encompasses three key components: Azolla, corals, and sea creatures, each representing critical aspects of aquatic ecosystems and their health.

### Azolla
The dataset includes two images of Azolla, a floating water plant known for its rapid growth and ecological significance. **One image depicts healthy Azolla**, showcasing its lush green leaves and vibrant life, symbolizing the vitality of healthy aquatic environments. **The second image portrays dying Azolla**, which starkly contrasts the first. This visual representation symbolizes the **deterioration of the water plant's life**, serving as a poignant reminder of the impacts of environmental stressors, such as pollution and climate change, on plant health.

### Corals
For the coral component, the dataset features a selection of images highlighting **both vibrantly colored corals**, representing the thriving ecosystems that support marine biodiversity, **and black-and-white pictures of corals**. The latter captures the coral bleaching process, where the loss of color indicates stress and declining health due to rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and other human-induced factors. This dual representation emphasizes the stark contrast between a healthy coral reef and one that is suffering, showcasing the urgent need for conservation efforts.

Conclusion
Together, these images provide a comprehensive visual narrative that highlights the fragility of aquatic ecosystems. They illustrate not only the beauty of these natural resources but also the critical challenges they face, underscoring the importance of environmental awareness and action.
